Welcome to the DevSecOps initiative and software repositories.  These repositories are meant to help build a community around DevOps + Security experimentation and lessons intended to help scale and deliver Rugged software.  This is the primary repository to help with understanding the mission and getting involved.  This is an actively evolving project and is intended to change over time.

This DevSecOps repository has been created to help security practitioners to understand DevSecOps, how to operate, and how to contribute to this effort.  

#What is DevSecOps?

In summary, DevSecOps is a Rugged experiment intended to help us understand how to operate and scale Security to support DevOps.  Several years ago, many of us realized that Josh Corman was right: **"This is the end of Security as we know it."**  And to ensure the continued safety of the software developed via DevOps, we decided to lean in to experiment and learn what was required to scale security decisions and speed up security feedback for DevOps teams.
